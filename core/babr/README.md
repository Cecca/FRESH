The code in the namespace `babr` was downloaded from 

  http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kbringma/frechetimpl/

It implements a fast algorithm for verifying that the distance of two curves is
below a given threshold.
I extracted the source files implementing the algorithm, adapting their interface to our code.

The code came with no license.
